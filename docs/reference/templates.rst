Crispy-forms-gds contains a base template, ``gds/base.html`` that is production ready
and can be used in your site. The template has several ``{% block %}`` tags which allow
various aspects of the template to be customised. The description of the ``Header``,
``Footer``, ``Skip link`` and ``Phase banner`` components in the ``Components`` section
describe each of the available blocks.

.. note::
    IMPORTANT: The template contains <svg> elements to display the crown and crown
    copyright logos. These are included as a convenience for projects and sites that
    are part of Her Majesty's Government. If your project is not directly part of
    the Government of the United Kingdom you expressly DO NOT have permission to display
    these logos and these sections must be overridden.
