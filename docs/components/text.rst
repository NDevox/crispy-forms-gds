The `Text input`_ component is the work-horse of any form: ::

    from django import forms

You can see this form live in the Demo site.

You might think that we went a little overboard with this as an example, but with
a little more effort we could have essentially cloned the entire content of the
`Text input`_ page from the GOV.UK Design System site - all within the form.

The only thing unique to Text inputs is that you can set the width so the field
is sized appropriately. The other features like setting the ``label_size`` and
``label_tag`` has been covered in the other components. It should be self-explanatory
if you have not seen it before.

Two things of note that are not covered elsewhere. You can set default sizes on the
``FormHelper`` instance. Here we set a default size for all ``<legend>`` elemennts
to small ('s'). This can then be overridden on each element that has a legend on a
case-by-case basis. The second thing not used else where is passing CSS classes on
layout objects. The first ``Div`` has margin added to inject some space before the
section on widths.

The widths themselves use all the available constants defined on hte ``Fixed`` and
``Fluid`` classes: ::

    Field.text("ten", field_width=FIXED.TEN),
    Field.text("one_quarter", field_width=Fluid.ONE_QUARTER),

You could just use the values directly: ::

    Field.text("ten", field_width=10),
    Field.text("one_quarter", field_width="one-quarter"),

The code in the ``Field`` class checks to see the value is valid. In the event a
new width is added to the Design System and this template pack has not been updated
you can always pass in the relevant CSS class directly: ::

    Field("ten", css_class="govuk-input--width-10"),
    Field("one_quarter", css_class="govuk-!-width-one-quarter"),
