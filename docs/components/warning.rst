Warning text
============
A `Warning text`_ component is simply HTML. It's included as a form component as
warnings are useful for frightening your users into filling out the form
correctly. ::

    from django import forms

    from crispy_forms_gds.helper import FormHelper
    from crispy_forms_gds.layout import HTML, Layout


    class WarningForm(forms.Form):
        def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
            super(WarningForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
            self.helper = FormHelper()
            self.helper.layout = Layout(
                HTML.warning(
                    "You can be fined up to Â£5,000 if you do not like this template pack."
                )
            )

You can see this form live in the Demo site.

At some point we will look into whether it is possible to change the symbol
colour and contents to create more general alerts.
