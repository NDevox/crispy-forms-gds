Design System
=============

There is support for all the `Design System Components`_ that you might expect to
encounter in a complex form.

The remaining components in the Design System list: `Breadcrumbs`, `Footer`, `Header`,
`Phase panel` and `Skip link` are page-level components and probably have limited utility
within a form nd are not supported, as yet. However `Summary list` has the potential for
being used in a form. We are just not sure how to implement it, given that the list contents
and specifically actions can be laid out in various ways.
